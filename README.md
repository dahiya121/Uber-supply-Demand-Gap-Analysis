# 🚖 Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

This project aims to identify and analyze the **supply-demand gap** in Uber ride requests using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python (EDA)**. By examining booking statuses, time slots, and pickup locations, we uncover operational inefficiencies and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize Uber's service.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Records:** 6,758 ride requests  
- **Features:** 11 columns (Request ID, Pickup Point, Driver ID, Status, Date/Time, Slot, etc.)  
- **Time Period:** 11th July – 17th July (single week)  
- **Pickup Points:** `City`, `Airport`  
- **Status Categories:** `Trip Completed`, `Cancelled`, `No Cars Available`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Excel:** Dashboarding, pivot tables, visual trend analysis  
- **SQL (MySQL):** Grouped aggregations, conditional queries, trend extraction  
- **Python:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for EDA and visualization

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📈 Over **58%** of all ride requests were **unfulfilled**.
- 🚫 **Airport pickup** had the highest service gaps, especially during **night** and **early morning** slots.
- ⏰ Peak demand hours: **6–10 AM** and **5–9 PM**.
- 🔥 Gap heatmaps show **Night and Early Morning** slots face up to **70% failure rate**.
- 📊 SQL and Python confirmed Excel visual trends with deeper granularity.
